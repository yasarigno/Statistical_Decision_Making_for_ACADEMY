### PROJET-2 
### Statistical analysis of educational systems
### Start-up project of the "ACADEMY"
---

In this project we analyse the dataset of the world bank data catalogue in order to help the ACADEMY, a start-up project, achieve its goals in the market.

Academy is an online education platform and wants to open up to a new country. Our aim is to determine whether the education data of the world bank can give us an idea about the expansion project.

We have obtained a list of countries which are possibly the most suitable ones for our start-up. More precisely, we have answered the following questions:

1. What are the countries with a high potential of customers for our services?
2. For each of these countries, what will be the evolution of this customer potential?
3. In which countries should the company operate in priority?
